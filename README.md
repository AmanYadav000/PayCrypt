## Features

- **AI Payment Integration Code Generator:**  
  Instantly generate payment gateway integration code for Stripe, PayPal, or Razorpay in Python, Node.js, or Java.

- **Voice Assistant:**  
  Use your microphone to ask payment-related questions and get answers from a knowledge base or Gemini LLM.

- **Real-Time Fraud Detection:**  
  Simulate and monitor transactions with anomaly detection (Isolation Forest), displaying risk scores and fraud alerts live.

- **Knowledge Base Automation:**  
  Ask questions and build a persistent, AI-augmented payment knowledge base.

## Usage

### 1. AI-Powered Payment Integration Code Generator

- Select a payment gateway and programming language.
- Optionally add custom instructions.
- Click **Generate Code** to get an AI-generated code snippet.

### 2. AI Voice Assistant

- Click **Start Listening** and speak your payment-related question.
- The assistant transcribes and answers using the knowledge base or Gemini LLM.

### 3. Real-Time Fraud Detection System

- Click **Start Monitoring** to simulate transactions.
- View each transaction's risk score and see fraud alerts in real time.
- Click **Stop Monitoring** to pause and see a summary of fraud alerts.

### 4. Payment Knowledge Base Automation

- Type your question and click **Get Answer**.
- The answer is fetched from the knowledge base or generated by Gemini, then saved for future use.
- Optionally, display the full knowledge base.

## Customization

- **Knowledge Base File:**  
The knowledge base is stored in `gemini_payment_knowledge_base.json` for persistence.

- **Synthetic Data:**  
Modify the `generate_synthetic_data` function to change transaction simulation parameters.

- **Fraud Detection Model:**  
Adjust Isolation Forest or replace with another model as needed.

- **UI Styling:**  
Custom CSS is injected via `st.markdown` for a modern look.
